<p aling="centre"> <i>A family is a group of people who share a deep bond of love and care. It consists of parents, children,<br> siblings, and sometimes grandparents and cousins. Families are like a close-knit team that supports and helps each other through thick and thin.
In todayâ€™s generation, they play a very important role in our lives. It is the people who we go to feel safe, loved, and pampered. They provide us with everything we need from support to care. They share our sorrows and feel happy about our achievements.
